    "# Neural Machine Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine translation is an important task in natural language processing and could be useful not only for translating one language to another but also for word sense disambiguation (e.g. determining whether the word \"bank\" refers to the financial bank, or the land alongside a river). Implementing this using just a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTMs can work for short to medium length sentences but can result in vanishing gradients for very long sequences. To solve this, you will be adding an attention mechanism to allow the decoder to access all relevant parts of the input sentence regardless of its length. By completing this assignment, you will:  "

One way to do that is to pad each sentence to the length of the longest sentence in the dataset. This might lead to some wasted computation though. For example, if there are multiple short sentences with just two tokens, do we want to pad these when the longest sentence is composed of a 100 tokens? Instead of padding with 0s to the maximum length of a sentence each time, we can group our tokenized sentences by length and bucket, as on this image (from the article above):\n",

    "\n",
    "In the model I built, I have used an encoder-decoder architecture. This Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) took in a tokenized version of a sentence in its encoder, then passed it to the decoder for translation. As I learned, using just a regular sequence-to-sequence model with LSTMs worked effectively for short to medium sentences but started to degrade for longer ones. The model compressed the entire context of the input sentence into one vector, which was then passed to the decoder block. For very long sentences (e.g., 100 tokens or more), this approach caused issues, as the early parts of the input had little effect on the final vector passed to the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, I added an attention layer, allowing the decoder access to all parts of the input sentence. For example, with a 4-word input sentence, the encoder produced a hidden state at each timestep, represented as orange rectangles. Each encoder hidden state was passed to the attention layer, where it was scored based on the current decoder hidden state. For instance, after predicting the word \"Wie,\" the attention layer received all encoder hidden states and the decoder hidden state at \"Wie\" to score each encoder state. The model might learn to focus on the second encoder state, assigning a high probability to the word \"geht\" as the next word. Using greedy decoding, the model would output \"geht,\" then repeat this process until reaching an end-of-sentence prediction.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This attention mechanism computed scores using queries (Q) and keys (K), followed by multiplying with values (V) to get a context vector for the decoder timestep. This context vector was fed to the decoder RNN to produce probabilities for the next word. Dividing by the square root of key dimensionality ($\\sqrt{d_k}$) improved model performance, as I would explore further. For machine translation, the encoder activations served as keys and values, while decoder activations served as queries.\n"
